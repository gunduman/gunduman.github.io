    <h1>Making a Lego House</h1>
    <p>Building a LEGO house starts with planning its size, baseplate, rooms, and features. Gather 
    varied bricks: basic bricks for walls, plates for floors, and essential windows and doors. 
    Begin by constructing the ground floor with outlines and frames, then lay plates for the next 
    floor's base before building its walls. For the roof, opt for flat plates or sloped bricks, ensuring
    proper support. Finish by adding exterior and interior details. Always stagger bricks for strength,
    and don't hesitate to experiment with designs.</p>
