    <p>🧩 1. Focus on Understanding, Not Memorizing

Don’t just memorize formulas — know why they work. <br>
Example: Instead of memorizing the quadratic formula, practice completing the square to see how it’s derived.<br>

When you understand the logic, you can rebuild the formula anytime.<br>

📝 2. Practice Actively, Not Passively<br>

Watching someone solve problems feels easy — doing it yourself is what makes it stick.<br>

Try: solve problems without looking at notes, then check where you went wrong.<br>

Redo mistakes a few days later — this builds long-term memory.<br>

🧠 3. Use the “Teach-Back” Trick<br>

After studying a topic, pretend you’re teaching it to someone else (even a wall works 😅).<br>

If you can explain it clearly, you really understand it.<br>

If not, that’s your cue to review that part again.<br>

📚 4. Mix Easy + Hard Questions<br>

Start with warm-up problems to boost confidence.<br>

Then try mixed-difficulty sets — they train your brain to switch between concepts (like factoring + fractions + exponents).<br>

⏰ 5. Use Short, Consistent Study Sessions<br>

Study 25–40 minutes → short break → repeat.<br>

Math learning builds up slowly, like muscles — daily practice beats last-minute cramming.<br>

🧮 6. Keep a “Mistake Log”<br>

Every time you mess up, write:<br>

The problem<br>

The mistake<br>

The correct solution<br>

Why it happened<br>

Review this log before exams — it’s way more useful than rereading notes.<br>

🎯 7. Use Multiple Resources<br>

If one explanation doesn’t click, try another:<br>

Khan Academy / PatrickJMT / 3Blue1Brown (for visuals)<br>

Textbook for formal steps<br>

ChatGPT 😄 for extra explanations<br>

🔢 8. Connect Topics<br>

Math builds on itself. When learning something new, ask:<br>

“What earlier topic does this connect to?”<br>
Example: Derivatives use algebra and limits; geometry proofs use logic rules.<br>

🎮 9. Gamify It<br>

Use apps like Brilliant, Mathway (practice mode), or Photomath (step study) to make drills more engaging.<br>
